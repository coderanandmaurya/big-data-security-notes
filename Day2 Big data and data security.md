## 🔹 **SECTION 1: Big Data Essentials**

### ✅ What Is Big Data?

Huge amounts of data generated at high speed—from sources like social media, mobile apps, and sensors—that traditional tools can’t handle well.([SpringerOpen][1], [Wikipedia][2])

### ✅ The 5 Vs of Big Data

Simple ways to describe big data:

* **Volume** – a lot of data
* **Velocity** – data created very fast
* **Variety** – lots of types: text, video, sensors
* **Veracity** – accuracy (some data can be wrong)
* **Value** – useful insights that can help make decisions([SpringerOpen][1])

### ✅ Why Big Data Matters

* Helps in making smart decisions in healthcare, finance, and retail.
* Example: Walmart processes petabytes of data every hour to manage stock, analyze buying trends, and improve customer experiences.

## 🔹 **SECTION 2: Introduction to Data Security**

### ✅ What Is Data Security?

Protecting digital information from theft, corruption, or unauthorized access throughout its life cycle.([Fortinet][3])

### ✅ Why It’s Important

* Keeps customer trust and brand reputation
* Ensures laws like GDPR or HIPAA are followed
* Prevents financial loss and legal penalties([Fortinet][3])

### ✅ The CIA Triad — The Core Principles

| Principle           | Simple Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidentiality** | Only the right people can see the data                              |
| **Integrity**       | Data is complete and hasn’t been changed                            |
| **Availability**    | Data is available when needed by authorized users([varonis.com][4]) |

---

### ✅ Common Security Tools & Techniques

* **Encryption**: Scrambles data so only authorized users can read it. Works both when data is stored and when it's sent over the internet.([QuestionPro][5])
* **Data Masking & Erasure**: Creates fake but realistic data or completely removes old data so sensitive info cannot be recovered.([QuestionPro][5])
* **Backup & Resilience**: Keep copies of data so it can be recovered fast after accidents, attacks, or disasters.([techtarget.com][6])
* **Access Controls & Authentication**: Limit who can access data; tools include strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based permissions.([Educative][7], [varonis.com][4])

### ⚠️ Smart & Simple Security Habits

1. Use long, unique passwords with symbols, numbers, upper/lowercase letters.([Educative][7], [security.it.utah.edu][8])
2. Turn on two-factor authentication (like SMS code or fingerprint).
3. Update software regularly to patch security holes.([cfmsaudi.com][9], [arxiv.org][10])
4. Learn to spot phishing emails and suspicious links.
5. Don’t keep sensitive data on phones or USBs unless encrypted. Backup your files securely.([QuestionPro][5])
6. Monitor unusual activity (e.g. unexpected file changes or login attempts).([QuestionPro][5], [Wikipedia][11])

### 📚 Case Study: Equifax Data Breach

**What happened?**

* Attackers used a known software flaw to access personal data of 147 million individuals.

**Why it happened?**

* Systems were not updated (no patch was applied).
* Sensitive data was not encrypted.
* No monitoring to detect breach quickly.([Fortinet][3], [QuestionPro][5])

**Lesson learned:**

* Always apply updates quickly.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* Monitor systems continuously for strange activities.

### 💼 Interview Questions – Data Security

1. Explain the CIA triad in simple words.
2. Why is encryption important, and when should you use it?
3. What’s the difference between authentication and access control?
4. How would you secure sensitive data on a school computer?
5. What would you do if you discovered someone logged into your account?

## ✅ Quick Recap (Day 2)

* **Big Data** is huge, fast, and varied data that helps businesses make smart choices.
* **Data Security** keeps data safe, accurate, and available only to the right people.
* **Key tools**: encryption, access control, backups, patching.
* **Case studies**: Walmart (using big data effectively), Equifax (a cautionary breach).
* **Practice questions**: Examples for interviews or exams.
