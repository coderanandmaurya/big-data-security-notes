## **Part 1 – Introduction to HIPAA (15 mins)**

**Lecture Content:**

* HIPAA stands for **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**, passed in **1996**.
* The act came at a time when:

  * Healthcare was shifting from paper to **electronic health records (EHRs)**.
  * Insurance was fragmented, and patients lost coverage when they changed jobs.
  * There was growing concern about **privacy of medical information**.

**Main Purposes of HIPAA**:

1. **Portability** – Ensures people don’t lose health insurance when switching jobs.
2. **Accountability** – Prevents fraud & abuse in healthcare.
3. **Administrative Simplification** – Introduces standardized **electronic transactions** and codes.
4. **Privacy & Security** – Protects patients’ health information from misuse.

**Definitions to Explain Clearly:**

* **PHI (Protected Health Information):** Any information about a patient’s health, treatment, or payment that can identify them.
  *Examples*: Name + medical condition, SSN + lab report, email + prescription.
* **ePHI:** PHI stored or transmitted electronically.

📌 **Interactive Activity**: Write 10 pieces of data on the board (e.g., Date of Birth, Doctor’s Name, Blood Pressure, School Name, Insurance ID, Twitter Handle). Ask students: *Which of these are PHI under HIPAA?*

## **Part 2 – HIPAA Rules in Detail (35 mins)**

### 1. **Privacy Rule** (2003)

* Protects **all forms of PHI** (paper, verbal, electronic).
* Patients’ Rights:

  1. Access their medical records.
  2. Request corrections.
  3. Request restrictions on sharing.
  4. Receive a list of disclosures.
* **“Minimum Necessary Rule”** → Only disclose the minimum info needed for the purpose.

**Example**: A billing clerk only needs access to billing info, not full medical history.

---

### 2. **Security Rule** (2005)

* Applies only to **ePHI**.
* Requires **3 Safeguards**:

  1. **Administrative** → Staff training, risk analysis, policies.
  2. **Physical** → Secure data centers, locked rooms, badge access.
  3. **Technical** → Encryption, access controls, automatic log-off, audit logs.

**Diagram for Slide**: 3 pillars of Security Rule with examples.

---

### 3. **Transactions & Code Sets Rule**

* Healthcare billing uses **standardized codes**: ICD, CPT, HCPCS.
* Example: Diabetes diagnosis is always coded the same way, avoiding confusion between providers and insurers.

---

### 4. **Unique Identifiers Rule**

* **NPI** (National Provider Identifier) – for doctors.
* **EIN** (Employer Identification Number) – for employers.
* **Health Plan Identifier** – for insurance companies.

---

### 5. **Enforcement Rule** (2006)

* HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) investigates complaints.
* Fines depend on level of negligence:

  * Tier 1: \$100–\$50,000/violation (unaware).
  * Tier 4: Up to \$1.5 million/year (willful neglect).

---

### 6. **Breach Notification Rule** (2009, HITECH Act)

* If PHI is exposed, organizations must notify:

  * **Individuals** within 60 days.
  * **HHS** if >500 records affected.
  * **Media** if >500 residents impacted.

**Case Study**: Anthem (2015) – 78 million records breached → \$16 million settlement.

---

📌 **Mini Quiz** (Quick Responses)

1. Which rule requires encryption? → Security Rule.
2. Which rule covers PHI in paper form? → Privacy Rule.
3. What’s the notification deadline after a breach? → 60 days.

---

## **Part 3 – HIPAA Compliance (20 mins)**

### **Covered Entities (CEs):**

* Healthcare providers (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies).
* Health plans (insurance companies, HMOs).
* Healthcare clearinghouses (process billing).

### **Business Associates (BAs):**

* Anyone handling PHI for CEs.
  *Examples*: Cloud providers, billing companies, EHR vendors, IT contractors.
* Must sign a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**.

---

### **Common Compliance Failures:**

1. Using unencrypted email for PHI.
2. Storing PHI on lost/stolen laptops.
3. Employees snooping on patient records.
4. Poor disposal of paper records.

📌 **Activity**: Split class into groups. Each group lists 3 ways their daily hospital/clinic workflow could accidentally break HIPAA.

---

## **Part 4 – HIPAA Violations & Penalties (20 mins)**

### **Examples of Violations**:

* *Celebrity snooping*: UCLA employees looked at Britney Spears’ medical records. Fine: \$865,000.
* *Data posted online*: NY Presbyterian uploaded PHI to Google search. Fine: \$3.3 million.
* *Laptop theft*: St. Joseph Health – unencrypted laptops stolen. Fine: \$2.14 million.

### **Penalties:**

* Civil: \$100 to \$50,000 per violation.
* Criminal: Up to \$250,000 fine & 10 years prison (if intent to profit from PHI).

📌 **Discussion Prompt**: Do you think employees who snoop on celebrity records should be jailed, or just fined?

---

## **Part 5 – HIPAA in Practice (25 mins)**

### **Healthcare Scenarios:**

* ✅ Doctor emailing encrypted MRI scans to a specialist.
* ❌ Nurse discussing patient’s HIV status in a crowded elevator.
* ❌ Receptionist leaving PHI on a voicemail without consent.

### **IT Scenarios:**

* ✅ Hospital IT team enabling **2-factor authentication** for EHR access.
* ❌ Business Associate storing PHI on unsecured cloud without BAA.

---

### **Modern Challenges:**

* **Telehealth** → Zoom/Teams consultations.
* **Wearables** → Apple Watch, Fitbit tracking heart rates.
* **AI** → Chatbots handling patient data.
* **Cybersecurity** → Ransomware targeting hospitals.

📌 **Case Example**: In 2020, ransomware attack shut down Universal Health Services → \$67 million in damages.

---

## **Part 6 – Best Practices (15 mins)**

**For Healthcare Workers:**

1. Never discuss PHI in public places.
2. Use secure messaging systems.
3. Shred paper records before disposal.

**For IT Teams:**

1. Encrypt all devices (laptops, mobile phones).
2. Use **Role-Based Access Control**.
3. Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
4. Regularly update and patch systems.

📌 **Quick Role Play**: One student plays “auditor” asking compliance questions, another plays “hospital admin” responding.

---

## **Part 7 – HIPAA vs Other Laws (10 mins)**

* **HIPAA (US)** → Focus: healthcare PHI.
* **GDPR (EU)** → Broader: personal data of all individuals.
* **CCPA (California)** → Consumer privacy, includes non-health data.

**Key Difference:**

* GDPR fines = % of company revenue (very high).
* HIPAA fines = capped but still severe.

📌 **Discussion**: Should HIPAA adopt GDPR-style penalties based on company revenue?

---

## **Part 8 – Future of HIPAA (10 mins)**

* Need for updates to cover:

  * Telehealth services.
  * IoT health devices.
  * AI diagnostic tools.
* Debate: Should PHI from wearables (Apple Watch, Fitbit) be under HIPAA?
* Prediction: HIPAA 2.0 may expand scope to cover *non-traditional healthcare data*.

---

## **Part 9 – Recap & Q\&A (10 mins)**

**Key Takeaways:**

* HIPAA protects **privacy, security, and integrity** of health data.
* Rules: Privacy, Security, Transactions, Identifiers, Enforcement, Breach Notification.
* Applies to **Covered Entities & Business Associates**.
* Violations bring **massive fines & jail time**.
* Compliance = Training, Encryption, Policies.
