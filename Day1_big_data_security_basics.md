## üîµ UNIT I: Introduction to Big Data and Data Security Basics

### 1. Overview of Big Data
Big Data refers to datasets so large or complex that traditional data processing tools can't manage them efficiently.

**Characteristics (5 Vs):**
- **Volume** ‚Äì Data size is in terabytes to zettabytes.
- **Velocity** ‚Äì Data is generated rapidly (e.g., real-time streaming, social media).
- **Variety** ‚Äì Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., logs, videos).
- **Veracity** ‚Äì Data quality and trustworthiness can vary.
- **Value** ‚Äì Insights or advantages extracted from data.

### 2. Use Cases of Big Data
- **Healthcare** ‚Äì Predictive diagnostics, genomics.
- **Retail** ‚Äì Customer behavior analysis, inventory prediction.
- **Finance** ‚Äì Fraud detection, credit scoring.
- **Manufacturing** ‚Äì Predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization.
- **Government** ‚Äì Smart cities, crime prediction.
- **Education** ‚Äì Learning analytics, adaptive learning systems.

### 3. Introduction to Data Security
Protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft across its lifecycle‚Äîat rest, in use, or in transit.

### 4. Data Management
Efficiently organizing, storing, and maintaining secure data.

### 5. Importance of Data Security
- Avoid reputational damage
- Comply with GDPR, HIPAA
- Prevent data theft or loss
- Ensure business continuity

### 6. Enterprise-Level Damage Due to Data Breach
- **Financial Losses** ‚Äì Lawsuits, penalties
- **Regulatory Fines** ‚Äì GDPR: Up to ‚Ç¨20M or 4% global turnover
- **Loss of Trust & Reputation**

### 7. Prevention of Data Breaches
- Role-based Access Control
- Data Encryption
- Monitoring & Logging
- Security Awareness Training

### 8. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** ‚Äì Only authorized access
- **Integrity** ‚Äì Data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** ‚Äì Data is available when needed

### 9. Data Securing Controls
- **Physical** ‚Äì Biometric access, CCTV
- **Technical** ‚Äì Encryption, firewalls
- **Administrative** ‚Äì Policies, training

### 10. Common Data Security Pitfalls
- Weak passwords
- Unpatched systems
- No incident response plan

### 11. Data Discovery and Classification
- **Discovery** ‚Äì Locate data across systems
- **Classification** ‚Äì Tag data by sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential)

### 12. Data Encryption
Makes data unreadable without a key.

- **Symmetric** ‚Äì Same key for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES)
- **Asymmetric** ‚Äì Public-private key pair (e.g., RSA)

### 13. Data Anonymization
Removing personal identifiers to protect privacy.

### 14. Tokenization
Replacing sensitive data with a meaningless token. Real data stored in a vault.

### 15. Risk Assessment
Identify threats/vulnerabilities to prioritize responses.

### 16. Data Auditing
Track access, changes, and anomalies.

### 17. Real-Time Alerting
Systems monitor and send alerts for suspicious activity.

### 18. Data Minimization
- Collect only what's needed
- Retain only as long as required
