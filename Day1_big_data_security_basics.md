# 🔐 Big Data Security – Complete Notes

---

## 🔵 UNIT I: Introduction to Big Data and Data Security Basics

### 1. Overview of Big Data
Big Data refers to datasets so large or complex that traditional data processing tools can't manage them efficiently.

**Characteristics (5 Vs):**
- **Volume** – Data size is in terabytes to zettabytes.
- **Velocity** – Data is generated rapidly (e.g., real-time streaming, social media).
- **Variety** – Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., logs, videos).
- **Veracity** – Data quality and trustworthiness can vary.
- **Value** – Insights or advantages extracted from data.

### 2. Use Cases of Big Data
- **Healthcare** – Predictive diagnostics, genomics.
- **Retail** – Customer behavior analysis, inventory prediction.
- **Finance** – Fraud detection, credit scoring.
- **Manufacturing** – Predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization.
- **Government** – Smart cities, crime prediction.
- **Education** – Learning analytics, adaptive learning systems.

### 3. Introduction to Data Security
Protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft across its lifecycle—at rest, in use, or in transit.

### 4. Data Management
Efficiently organizing, storing, and maintaining secure data.

### 5. Importance of Data Security
- Avoid reputational damage
- Comply with GDPR, HIPAA
- Prevent data theft or loss
- Ensure business continuity

### 6. Enterprise-Level Damage Due to Data Breach
- **Financial Losses** – Lawsuits, penalties
- **Regulatory Fines** – GDPR: Up to €20M or 4% global turnover
- **Loss of Trust & Reputation**

### 7. Prevention of Data Breaches
- Role-based Access Control
- Data Encryption
- Monitoring & Logging
- Security Awareness Training

### 8. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized access
- **Integrity** – Data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** – Data is available when needed

### 9. Data Securing Controls
- **Physical** – Biometric access, CCTV
- **Technical** – Encryption, firewalls
- **Administrative** – Policies, training

### 10. Common Data Security Pitfalls
- Weak passwords
- Unpatched systems
- No incident response plan

### 11. Data Discovery and Classification
- **Discovery** – Locate data across systems
- **Classification** – Tag data by sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential)

### 12. Data Encryption
Makes data unreadable without a key.

- **Symmetric** – Same key for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES)
- **Asymmetric** – Public-private key pair (e.g., RSA)

### 13. Data Anonymization
Removing personal identifiers to protect privacy.

### 14. Tokenization
Replacing sensitive data with a meaningless token. Real data stored in a vault.

### 15. Risk Assessment
Identify threats/vulnerabilities to prioritize responses.

### 16. Data Auditing
Track access, changes, and anomalies.

### 17. Real-Time Alerting
Systems monitor and send alerts for suspicious activity.

### 18. Data Minimization
- Collect only what's needed
- Retain only as long as required
